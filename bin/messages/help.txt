*** PURPOSE ***
I thought it would be fun to learn the windows command shell in a more friendly and safe envrionmet.
This is a help manual and educational book in interactive script form.

Eventually, you'll want to know a few hundred WIN* and *NIX commands.  That can overwhelming at first.
This interactive tutorial will focus on the most commonly used commands and concepts. The rest will come naturally!


*** WHY LEARN A SHELL ***
Unless you're a kernel developer, you only have two major avenues to speak to your kernel:
a GUI (graphical shell) - *clicking sounds*.
a CLI (shell) - *typing sounds*.
Both give you a different superpower :).


*** WHAT IS A SHELL ***
It's not a unicorn! It's a program that converts your commands to kernel talk and vice versa.
You're not afraid of programs, are you?!


*** WHY NOT LINUX OR ANOTHER LANGUAGE ***
Why not both?  I like to start here because it is familiar and simple.
After this tutorial, review the source code to see how these things are made.
After that, I recommend Bash or Powershell.
Feeling adventurious? Learn git, then Python! (Free books below).
